# Authentication

IMLUI supports classic user/password authentication as well as authentication via [OpenID Connect](Technologies#openid-connect) or [OAuth 2.0](Technologies#oauth20), i.e. the option to sign in with Google/Github/Facebook etc. Currently supported authentication providers are:

* [github.de](https://github.com/)

Soon to be added Authentication providers are:

* [auth.spang-lab.de](https://auth.spang-lab.de/)
* [gitlab.spang-lab.de](https://gitlab.spang-lab.de/)
* [github.de](https://github.com/)
* [google.com](https://www.google.com/)
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/)
* [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/)

Should you opt for authentication via *OpenID Connect*/*OAuth 2.0*, at least a unique ID will be retrieved from the respective identity provider. If available, your name, email and profile picture will be retrieved as well.

# Internal Authorization

**🛠️TODO**: this section is outdated.

By default, user authorization, i.e. the management of user permissions, is handled by IMLUI directly. For information on how to configure an external identity provider as authorization source, please refer to section [External Authorization](#external-authorization). IMLUI's internal authorization mechanism works as follows:

1. For each user an entry is created in table `users` (1) after the user's first login.
2. Permission to access specific models, datasets and/or services, is stored as a entry in tables `mapping_groups_models`.

Example: it is possible to grant `use` (3) access for dataset `Lenz_2008_train` to groups `spang-lab-phd-students` and `spang-lab-master-students` and to grant `download` access to group `imlui-admins` and user `uid12345`.

(1): Columns of table `users` are e.g. `user_id`, `google_id`, `github_id`, `email`, `password`, `group_ids` and `display_name`\
(2): Columns of table `dataset_permissions`/`resource_permissions` are e.g.`dataset_id`, `resource_id` and `permission_id`. Possible values for `permission_id` are: `list`, `view` and `download`.\
(3): Side-note: there is no `write` or `change` permissions, because datasets are immutable objects. If anything has to be changed, that new dataset must obtain a different ID.

# External Authorization

**🛠️TODO**: the behaviour described in this section is not implemented yet.

IMLUI can be configured to use an external identity provider such as [auth.spang-lab.de](https://auth.spang-lab.de/) for authorization. This is implemented as follows: when user `uidX` logs in via identity provider `authY.com`, then

1. All groups `G={g1, g2, ...}` assigned to `uidX` are retrieved from `authY.com`
2. New rows
   + `group_id=g1, user_id=uidX, granted_by=authY.com`
   + `group_id=g2, user_id=uidX, granted_by=authY.com`
   + `...`
   are added to table `groups`, if they don't exist yet.
3. All rows matching `group_id=.*, user_id=uidX, granted_by=authY.com` are retrieved from table `users`. If any `group_id` is found, that is no longer an element of `G`, those entries are removed.

This way, access to resources can be given to groups defined by `authY.com` and whenever a user signs in via `authY.com` he automatically is added to those groups (or removed from them).

To enable authorization via an external identity provider, login as admin and go to `Settings` > `Authorization` > `Enabled external authorization providers` and tick the checkbox of the external identity provider you want to enable.
